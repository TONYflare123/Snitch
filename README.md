### Activity of group chat plummets. Message count drop harder than a grandma falling from the stairs. 😶‍🌫️
As the end of the year approaches,  there has been a dip in group chat activity, with the average approximate message count dropping from 200 msg/day to 5 msg/day. The reason still remains a mystery however, the editor’s prophecy seems to becoming true.

## Was 2025 really a WTF year? 🤨

**First of all - what’s a wtf year?**

idrk but a year starting with Wednesday is known as a wtf year since the Wednesday,-Thursday-Friday trilogy is complete. Such years are known to have crazy events, take for example take 2020, the covid era.

Evaluating the year...

Now now, 2025 started off the same as 2020. Thunderstorms in early March and rain set in pretty early, and ominous clouds lurked over us but who knew those clouds represented something else which nobody knows and nobody cares about. Fast forward to  April, the session started off with an unexpected 2 week holiday but things really spiced up after the summer break...

We got countless free periods (10B only, I’m sowwy other sections hehe :3) and as fall set in the true wtf moments began. First oyon and bhasko’s love was publicly known then emerged the cult which tortured Fuhrer and VSC. Then emerged the local terrorist with his famous painting;
These events in turn paved way for the first snitch. 

Following these events were even crazier ones. Ranging from propagandas and funerals of the local (beloved) insects to Pharaoh’s comedy show and coffee in the class. This year, truly was one heck of a show!

### Quiet kid’s identity revealed! 🔫 

One of the most active members of the gc, ironically is one of the most mysterious ones, with only 5 people aware of his true identity. His activity is rare during the day but as night falls, he becomes alive again, and goes on to lurk in the gc, with a gun; occasionally sending a message or two (ok maybe more than that) and he none other than our local quiet kid whose real name is:

***Deb dutta*** - the great defender

## Great meme reset round the corner

FINALLY THE BRAINROT IS GOING TO BE DEAD (maybe, it already is idk) but the resistive force of gen z people was strong enough to halt the further progress and popularity of brainrot. Take for example labubu dolls, they’re dead now. I don’t even have anything much to write here, why did I even include this in the paper. Anyways the great meme reset ain’t doing no shit, the so called hope might be all bullshit, we don’t really know. Anyways lets see what 2026 has in store for us.

"eeaahhhhhhhhhhh" - The chicken, about to be offered for sacrifice to save 2026 from brainrot.

# Game dev weekly 🎮

A game dev, from the group **Flarium** is working on a sci-fi action horror game. Till now, a great progress has been seen on the mechanics of the game. The game is *Even After*
> Even After death, there is no rest
Expected to be released during Nov 2026 on itch.io.

# Changes in the snitch from now onwards

Its not like I can’t do design well. The geometry dash editor skills really pay off in ths field. Anyways what I mean to say is that to preserve the originality of the og snitch on paper, I decided to go for a basic design online too, however as I plan to expand things, this is going to change. Design would be in the hands of Flarium from now on also this is the last snitch in picture.

> NOT BY THE EDITOR! REPEAT, NOT BY THE EDITOR!

It all started with a spark, a spark of the eye. Every day, those glossy pair of bright aquamarine eyes looked at the visitors with hope, however the shine got dimmer with each visitor leaving leaving empty handed or with someone else, as if they also took a fragment of the hope along with them.
This year’s Christmas also seemed the same - sitting in front of slice of thin, donated, stale cake with nothing but an old hand down itchy sweater, and the dim string lights on the frail, old Christmas tree to keep warm. It was still a few days to Christmas but hope while leaving had left the door open for the eyes to see what fate had in store for them but at last, she was adopted. She was what someone could expect from a village urchin, save for her blue eyes. On the ride back home, her joy knew no bounds. Her wish of having a warm family for Christmas was fulfilled but that joy was short lived as she knew that she was adopted as a present for someone, which made her feel like a commodity rather than their daughter. nevertheless, she accepted her fate, hoping for the best.
After a seemingly long ride, she finally reached her new home, which was almost identical to her old one. It was a humble one storeyed house, rather large from the outside The warm orange windows, producing a contrast to the white snow and greyish wood and cement.  The inside was not large too, but well decorated. The house smelled of fresh peppermint and freshly baked cookies. Her mere luggage was put into one of the two bedrooms and she was sent to take a warm bath. After the bath she went to her “new” room. It was disheartening to see it already occupied but seeing empty space reserved for her in the cupboard and the desk cheered her up a bit. The bed and desk were rather large and there was almost no free space in the room, which made it look oddly cozy in the warm orange lights. After organising her books and clothes, she noticed the plate of freshly baked cookies and a glass of warm peppermint milk, which she was not enthusiastic for as she thought it to be thin watery milk and rock hard cookie she had before. The moment she took the first bite, it dissolved in her mouth and the milk had a rich flavour with hints of peppermint. She enoyed every last bit of it, so much that she didn’t hear the calls of her adoptive mom. When she came to check on her, she was pleased to find her enjoying the cookies...to be continued...
