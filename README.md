### Activity of group chat plummets. Message count drop harder than a grandma falling from the stairs.
As the end of the year approaches,  there has been a dip in group chat activity, with the average approximate message count dropping from 200 msg/day to 5 msg/day. The reason still remains a mystery however, the editor’s prophecy seems to becoming true.

## Was 2025 really a WTF year?

**First of all - what’s a wtf year?**

idrk but a year starting with Wednesday is known as a wtf year since the Wednesday,-Thursday-Friday trilogy is complete. Such years are known to have crazy events, take for example take 2020, the covid era.

Evaluating the year...

Now now, 2025 started off the same as 2020. Thunderstorms in early March and rain set in pretty early, and ominous clouds lurked over us but who knew those clouds represented something else which nobody knows and nobody cares about. Fast forward to  April, the session started off with an unexpected 2 week holiday but things really spiced up after the summer break...

We got countless free periods (10B only, I’m sowwy other sections hehe :3) and as fall set in the true wtf moments began. First oyon and bhasko’s love was publicly known then emerged the cult which tortured Fuhrer and VSC. Then emerged the local terrorist with his famous painting;
These events in turn paved way for the first snitch. 

Following these events were even crazier ones. Ranging from propagandas and funerals of the local (beloved) insects to Pharaoh’s comedy show and coffee in the class. This year, truly was one heck of a show!
